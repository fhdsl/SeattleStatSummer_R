I like writing.  I like **bold** things.  I like *italicized*.

* I am a list
* I am bullet 2


1.  I am a numbered list
7.  It doesn't matter what numbers you use
8.  markdown doens't care

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
tab = table(cars$speed > 5, cars$dist > 4)
knitr::kable(tab)
```

The number of cars with speed greater than 5 is `r sum(cars$speed > 5)`.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g = ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
print(g)
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
ggplotly(g)
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.width= 3.5, fig.height=7, fig.cap="This is the pressure figure"}
plot(pressure)
```

Figure \ref{fig:pressure} is awesome.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
