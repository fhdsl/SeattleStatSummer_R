*Signing up for the class Slack channel:*

We have launched a Slack workspace for the class. For those of you who are using Slack for the first time: Slack is a collaboration platform that allows connecting people within a group or organization. Here, we have created a Slack workspace to facilitate discussion within students themselves, as well as with TAs and instructors. We hope this chat platform will allow you to discuss and clarify lecture content and homework. Slack has worked well for that purpose in other classes' offerings, and we hope it will continue to be a useful tool for you. 

To join the Slack workspace "140.604.73 Intro to R for Public health", follow the instructions:
1. Click this invitation link <PASTE> (expires after two days, please request another if needed)
2. Once you have added your email and password, you can log in here: https://14060473intro-cnb6679.slack.com/
3. Once you log in to the Slack workspace, you should be able to see a welcome message displayed in the "general" channel which includes a short Slack tutorial too.

See everyone on Monday!

Thanks,
Ava, Carrie, and Candace
