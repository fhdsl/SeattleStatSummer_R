## Writing your own functions

This is a brief introduction. The syntax is:

```
functionName = function(inputs) {
< function body >
return(value)
}
```

Then you would run the 4 lines of the code, which adds it to your workspace.

## Writing your own functions

Here we will write a function that returns the second element of a vector:

```{r return2, comment=""}
return2 = function(x) {
  return(x[2])
}
return2(c(1,4,5,76))
```

## Writing your own functions

Note that your function will automatically return the last line of code run:

```{r return2a, comment=""}
return2a = function(x) {
  x[2]
}
return2a(c(1,4,5,76))
```

And if your function is really one line or evaluation, like here, you do not need the curly brackets, and you can put everything on one line:

```{r return2b, comment=""}
return2b = function(x) x[2]
return2b(c(1,4,5,76))
```

## Writing your own functions

Also note that functions can take multiple inputs. Maybe you want users to select which element to extract

```{r return2c, comment=""}
return2c = function(x,n) x[n]
return2c(c(1,4,5,76), 3)
```

## Writing a simple function

Let's write a function, `sqdif`, that:

1. takes two numbers `x` and `y` with default values of 2 and 3.
2. takes the difference
3. squares this difference
4. then returns the final value 

## Writing a simple function

```{r sqdif, comment=""}
sqdif <- function(x=2,y=3){
     (x-y)^2
}

sqdif()
sqdif(x=10,y=5)
sqdif(10,5)
```

## Writing your own functions

Try to write a function called `top()` that takes a `matrix` or `data.frame`, and returns the first `n` rows and columns, with the default value of `n=5`.

## Writing your own functions

Try to write a function called `top()` that takes a `matrix` or `data.frame`, and returns the first `n` rows and columns

```{r top, comment=""}
top = function(mat,n=5) mat[1:n,1:n]
my.mat = matrix(1:1000,nr=100) 
top(my.mat) #note that we are using the default value for n 
```

## Custom functions in `apply`

You can also designate functions "on the fly"
```{r top3, comment=""}
matList = list(x = matrix(1:25,nc=5),y=matrix(26:50,nc=5))
lapply(matList, function(x) x[1:2,1:2])
```

## Simple apply 

`sapply()` is useful for lists and data frames. It attempts to make an array with the same length as the input.

```{r sapply1, comment=""}
df = data.frame(day1 = c(600,660), day2 = c(440, 500))
df
sapply(df, log)
```

---

```{r sapply2, comment=""}
myList = list(a=1:10, b=c(2,4,5), c = c("a","b","c"),
                d = factor(c("boy","girl","girl")))
tmp = lapply(myList,function(x) x[1])
tmp
sapply(tmp, class)
```

---

`sapply` can also be applied to columns of data frames

```{r sapplyDf, comment="", message=FALSE}
library(readr)
circ = read_csv(paste0("http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/",
  "data/Charm_City_Circulator_Ridership.csv"))
sapply(circ,class)
```
