## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics developed in 1991

- R is the open source implementation of the [S language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was developed by [Bell laboratories](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T023TPZA8LF-U024EN26Q0L-113294823b2c-512) in the 70s.

- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

```{r, fig.alt="Bell Labs old logo", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Bell_Laboratories_logo.svg/2880px-Bell_Laboratories_logo.svg.png")
```


<sub>[source: http://www.r-project.org/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs)] </sub>

## What is R?

- **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand developed R


- R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development)

```{r, fig.alt="R logo", out.width = "20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png")
```


<sub>[source: http://www.r-project.org/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)]</sub>

## Why R?

* Free (open source)

* High level language designed for statistical computing

* Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and visualization

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Strong community 

```{r, fig.alt="R-Ladies - a non-profit civil society community", out.width = "20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/img/R-LadiesGlobal_RBG_online_LogoOnly.png")
```
<sub>[source: https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/]</sub>

## Why not R?

    
* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Annoying to update

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Perl, Python)

```{r, fig.alt="tortoise and hare", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tortoise_hare.jpg")
```

## Grading

 1. Attendance/Participation: 20% - this can be asynchronous - just some sort of interaction with the instructors/TAs (turning in assignments, emailing etc.)
 2. Homework: 3 x 15%
 3. Final "Project": 35%

Homework and Final Project due by **Wednesday, Jan 25, 2022 at 11:59pm EST**.

If you turn homework in earlier this can allow us to potentially give you feedback earlier.
 
Note: Only people taking the course for credit must turn in the assignments. However, we will evaluate all submitted assignments in case others would like feedback on their work.

<!-- ## Grading -->

<!-- * **Homework 1**: Due Tuesday by class -->

<!-- * **Homework 2**: Due Thursday by class -->

<!-- * **Homework 3**: Due Friday by class -->

<!-- * **Project**: Due 2 weeks after class ends -->

## Your Setup

If you can, we suggest working virtually with a **large monitor or two screens**. This setup allows you to follow along on Zoom while also doing the hands-on coding.

## Installing R

* Install the latest version from: [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/ )

* [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

RStudio is an **integrated development environment** (IDE) that makes it easier to work with R.

More on that soon!

## Basic terms

R jargon: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4419-1318-0%2F1.pdf

**Package** - a package in R is a bundle or "package" of code (and or possibly data) that can be loaded together for easy repeated use or for **sharing** with others.

Packages are sort of analogous to a software application like Microsoft Word on your computer. Your operating system allows you to use it, just like having R installed (and other required packages) allows you to use packages.

```{r, fig.alt="R hex stickers for packages", out.width = "35%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hex.png")
```

## Basic terms


**Function** - a function is a particular piece of code that allows you to do something in R. You can write your own, use functions that come directly from installing R, or use functions from additional packages.

A function might help you add numbers together, create a plot, or organize your data. More on that soon!

```{r}
sum(1, 20234)
```


## Basic terms

 **Argument** - what you pass to a function

- can be data like the number 1 or 20234 

```{r}
sum(1, 20234)
```

- can be options about how you want the function to work such as `digits`

```{r}
round(0.627, digits = 2)
round(0.627, digits = 1)
```


## Basic terms


**Object** - an object is something that can be worked with in R - can be lots of different things!

- a matrix of numbers
- a plot
- a function

... many more

## Variable and Sample

- **Variable**: something measured or counted that is a characteristic about a sample

examples: temperature, length, count, color, category

- **Sample**: individuals that you have data about -

examples: people, houses, viruses etc.

```{r}
head(iris)
```


## Columns and Rows

```{r, fig.alt="R hex stickers for packages", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://keydifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/rows-vs-column.jpg")
```
[[source](https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-rows-and-columns.html)]

Sample = Row  
Variable = Column

Data objects that looks like this is often called a **data frame**.

Fancier versions from the tidyverse are called **tibbles** (more on that soon!).


## More on Functions and Packages

* When you download R, it has a "base" set of functions/packages (**base R**)  
    * You can install additional packages for your uses from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
    * These additional packages are written by RStudio or R users/developers (like us)  
    
    
```{r, fig.alt="Picture of R package stickers", out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../Intro/images/hex.png")
```


## Using Packages

* Not all packages available on CRAN or GitHub are trustworthy
* RStudio (the company) makes a lot of great packages
* Who wrote it? **Hadley Wickham** is a major authority on R (Employee and Developer at RStudio)
* How to [trust](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/11/06/how-i-decide-when-to-trust-an-r-package/) an R package

## Tidyverse and Base R

We will mostly show you how to use tidyverse packages and functions. 

This is a newer set of packages designed for data science that can make your code more **intuitive** as compared to the original older Base R.

**Tidyverse advantages**:  
 - **consistent structure** - making it easier to learn how to use different packages  
 - particularly good for **wrangling** (manipulating, cleaning, joining) data  
 - more flexible for **visualizing** data  

Packages for the tidyverse are managed by a team of respected data scientists at RStudio.

```{r, fig.alt="Tidyverse hex sticker", out.width = "10%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

See this [article](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/paper.html) for more info.


## Collection of R packages

We have an R package called jhur that will make sure all the packages are installed.

You can just copy and paste the code below into your RStudio console - we'll explain what it all means in the next day or two.

```{r, packageInstall, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
install_github("jhudsl/jhur")
```

Note it may take ~5-10 minutes to run.

## Generally Installing Packages

You can typically install packages (which only needs to be done once) with each version installation of R using:

tools > Install Packages

```{r, fig.alt="The End", out.width = "20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install_packages1.png")
```

```{r, fig.alt="The End", out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/install_packages2.png")
```

## Loading packages

After installing packages, each time you use them you will need to "load" them into memory - so that you can actively use them.

This is typically done using a function called `library` to load the package.

Here we "load" the `dplyr` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

We will cover this many times so just worry about the term "load" and the function `library` for now
