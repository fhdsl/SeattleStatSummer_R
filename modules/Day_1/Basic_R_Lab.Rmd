In this lab you can use the interactive console to explore or **Knit** the document. 
Remember anything you type here can be "sent" to the console with Cmd-Enter (OS-X) or Ctrl-Enter (Windows/Linux) in an R code chunk.


# Part 1

1\. Create a new object called `my.num` that contains 6 numbers.

```
# General format
my.num <- c(number1, number2, ...)
```

```{r}

```


2\. Multiply `my.num` by 4.

```{r}

```


3\. Create a second object called `my.char` that contains 5 character strings.

```
# General format
my.char <- c("character1", "character2", ...)
```

```{r}

```


4\. Combine the two objects `my.num` and `my.char` into an object called `both`.

```{r}

```


5\. What is the length of `both`? Use the `length()` function.

```{r}

```


6\. What class is `both`?

```{r}

```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Create a vector that contains 4 sets of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

```{r}

```


# Part 2

7\. Divide `both` by 3, what happens?

```{r, error=TRUE}

```


8\. Create a vector with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and call it `x`.

```
# General format
x <- c(...)
```

```{r}

```


9\. Create another vector with elements 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and call it `y`.

```
# General format
y <- c(...)
```

```{r}

```


10\. Determine the length of `x` and `y`. Next, add them together.

```{r}

```


11\. Append the value 60 onto the vector `y` (hint: you can use the `c()` function).

```
# General format
y <- c(y, ...)
```

```{r}

```


12\. Determine the length of `x` and `y`.

```{r}

```


13\. Add `x` and `y` together. What happens?

```{r}

```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Multiply the following `a` and `b` together. How is this similar to the way R performs addition in #10 ?

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(10, 100, 1000)
```


14\. Practice loading the `tidyverse` package. Remember you will need to install it if you haven't already.

```
# General format
library(...)
```

```{r}

```


15\. There is a function inside the tidyverse called `count()`. Open up the help page about `count()` using a `?`. What is the title of the help page?

```
# General format
?function
```

```{r}

```
