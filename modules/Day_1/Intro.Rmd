## The Learning Curve

Learning a programming language can be very intense and sometimes overwhelming.

We recommend fully diving in and making lots of mistakes through trial and error.

We want you to succeed -- We will get through this together!

```{r, fig.alt="Sweeping the ocean", out.width = "25%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sweeping-the-ocean.gif")
```

## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics developed in 1991

- R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development) (aka, free!)

```{r, fig.alt="R logo", out.width = "20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png")
```

- Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and visualization

- Extensive add-on software (packages)

- Strong community -- https://rladies.org/

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding basic programming syntax
- Reading data into R
- Summarizing and grouping data
- Filtering data
- Recoding data
- Making plots with your data

## Installing R

* Install the [latest R version](http://cran.r-project.org/) `r config::get("r_version")`

* [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

More detailed instructions [on the website](https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/docs/module_details/day0.html).

RStudio is an **integrated development environment** (IDE) that makes it easier to work with R.

More on that soon!
