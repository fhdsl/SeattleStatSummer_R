## Recap
- R functions as a calculator
- Use `c()` to **combine** vectors
- Use `<-` to save (assign) values to objects
- if you don't use `<-` to reassign objects that you want to modify, they will stay the same
- `length()`, `class()`, and `str()` tell you information about an object
- `head()` and `tail()` can also help you inspect an object
- `readr`has helpful functions like `read_csv()` that can help you import data into R like so: 
`df_example_readr <- read_csv(file = "documents/data_analysis/data_file.csv")`
- Need to assign the output of the function to keep the result!

## Overview

In this module, we will show you how to:

1. Look at your data in different ways
4. Rename columns of a data frame
5. Subset rows of a data frame
6. Subset columns of a data frame
7. Add new columns to a data frame



## Setup

We will largely focus on the `dplyr` package which is part of the `tidyverse`.

```{r, fig.alt="dplyr", out.width = "25%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

Some resources on how to use `dplyr`: 

* https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html
* https://www.opencasestudies.org/




## Loading in dplyr and tidyverse

See this website for a list of the packages included in the `tidyverse`: https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr and other packages!
```

## Getting data to work with

Here we use one of the datasets that comes with base R called `mtcars`. We can take a look at the top of it by using the `head()` function.

```{r}
head(mtcars) # looking at the top 6 rows of the mtcars data
mtcars_og <- mtcars
```

## To see the bottom of the data use `tail()`
```{r}
tail(mtcars) # looking at the bottom 6 rows of the mtcars data
```

## Checking the data: `glimpse()`

In addition to `head()` and `tail()`, the `glimpse()`function of the `dplyr` package  is another great function to look at your data. 

```{r}
glimpse(mtcars)
```


## Renaming Columns of a data frame or tibble

To rename columns in `dplyr`, you can use the `rename` function.

For example, let's rename mpg to MPG. Notice the new name is listed **first**!

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# general format! not code!
{data you are creating or changing} <- rename({data you are using}, 
                                          {New Name} = {Old name})
```
</div>

```{r}
mtcars_rename <- rename(mtcars, MPG = mpg)
head(mtcars_rename)
```


## Take Care with Column Names

When you can, avoid spaces, special punctuation, or numbers in column names, as these require special treatment to refer to them. 

See https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/quotes_vs_backticks.html for more guidance.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars_rename <- rename(mtcars_rename, MPG! = MPG) # this will cause an error
```

```{r}
mtcars_rename <-rename(mtcars_rename, `MPG!` = MPG) # this will work
head(mtcars_rename, 2)
```


## Unusual Column Names

It's best to avoid unusual column names where possible, as things get tricky later.

We just showed the use of \` backticks\` . You may see people use quotes as well.

```{r, fig.alt="dplyr", out.width = "14%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/backtick_1.png")
```

Other atypical column names are those with:

- spaces
- number without characters
- number starting the name
- other punctuation marks (besides "_" or "." and not at the beginning)


## A solution!

Rename tricky column names so that you don't have to deal with them later!

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/6q29hxDKvJvPy/giphy.gif")
```

## Be careful about copy pasting code!

Curly quotes will not work!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars_rename <-rename(mtcars, ‘MPG!’ = MPG) # this will cause an error!
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars_rename <-rename(mtcars, `MPG!` = MPG) # this will work!
```

Also true for double quotes
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars_rename <-rename(mtcars, “MPG!” = MPG) # this will cause an error!
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars_rename <-rename(mtcars, "MPG!" = MPG) # this will work!
```

## Let's stick with lowercase



## Summary

- data frames are simpler version of a data table
- tibbles are fancier `tidyverse` version
- data frames are made with `data.frames()` and `read.csv()`
- tibbles are made with `tibble()` and `read_csv()` from `readr`
- if your original data has rownames, you need to use `rownames_to_column` before converting to tibble
- the `rename()` function of `dplyr` can help you rename columns
- avoid using punctuation (except underscores), spaces, and numbers (to start or alone) in column names
- if you must do a nonstandard column name - typically use backticks around it. See https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/quotes_vs_backticks.html.
- avoid copy and pasting code from other sources - quotation marks will change!

# Subsetting Columns

## Subset columns of a data frame - `tidyverse` way: 

To grab (or "pull" out) the `carb` column the `tidyverse` way we can use the `pull` function:
```{r}
pull(mtcars, carb)
```


## Subset columns of a data frame: dplyr

The `select` command from `dplyr` allows you to subset (still a `tibble`!)
```{r}
select(mtcars, carb)
```

## Select multiple columns

We can use `select` to select for multiple columns.

```{r}

select(mtcars, carb, gear)
```

## Subset columns of a data frame: dplyr

Note that if you want the values (not a `tibble`), use `pull` - as it pulls out the data:
```{r}
pull(mtcars, gear)

# pull with select works too!

pull(select(mtcars, gear))
```

## Select columns of a data frame: dplyr

The `select` command from `dplyr` allows you to subset columns matching patterns:

```{r}
head(mtcars, 2)
select(mtcars, starts_with("c"))
```

## See the Select "helpers"

Here are a few:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
last_col()
starts_with()
ends_with()
contains() # like searching
```

Type `tidyselect::` in the **console** and see what RStudio suggests:

```{r, fig.alt="dplyr", out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyselect.png")
```

## Combining tidyselect helpers with regular selection

```{r}
head(mtcars, 2)
select(mtcars, starts_with("d"), gear)
```
## Multiple tidyselect functions

Follows OR logic.

```{r}
select(mtcars, starts_with("c"), ends_with("r"))

```

## Multiple patterns with tidyselect

Need to combine the patterns with the `c()` function.

```{r}
select(mtcars, starts_with(c("c", "d")))

```


## The `where()` function can help select columns of a specific class{.codesmall}

`is.character()` and `is.numeric()` are often the most helpful

```{r}
head(mtcars, 2)
select(mtcars, where(is.numeric))

```




# Subsetting Rows

## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr

The command in `dplyr` for subsetting rows is `filter`.

```{r}
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20)
```


## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr

You can have multiple logical conditions using the following:

* `==` : equals to
* `!=`: not equal to (`!` : not/negation)
* `>` / `<`: greater than / less than
* `>=` or `<=`: greater than or equal to / less than or equal to
* `&` : AND
* `|` : OR

## Common error for filter

If you try to filter for a column that does not exist it will not work:
 
 - misspelled column name 
 - column that was already removed 



## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

You can filter by two conditions using `&` or commas (must meet both conditions):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20, cyl == 4) # same result
```

```{r}
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20 & cyl == 4)
```

## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr

If you want OR statements (meaning the data can meet either condition does not need to meet both), you need to use `|` between conditions:

```{r}
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20 | cyl == 4)

```

## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

The `%in%` operator can be used find values from a pre-made list (using `c()`) for a **single column** at a time. 

```{r}
filter(mtcars, mpg %in% c(20,21,22))

filter(mtcars, mpg == 20 | mpg == 21 | mpg == 22) #equivalent
```

## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

The `%in%` operator can be used find values from a pre-made list (using `c()`) for a **single column** at a time.

```{r}
filter(mtcars, gear %in% c(4,5), cyl %in% c(6,5))

```

## Be careful with column names and `filter`

This will not work the way you might expect! Best to stick with nothing but the column name if it is a typical name. 

```{r}
filter(mtcars, "mpg" > 20)
```

## Don't use quotes for atypical names

Atypical names are those with punctuation, spaces, start with a number, or are just a number. 

```{r}
mtcars <- rename(mtcars, `mpg!` = mpg)

filter(mtcars, "mpg!" > 22) # will not work correctly
```

## Be careful with column names and `filter`

Using backticks works!

```{r}
filter(mtcars, `mpg!` > 22)
```




## `filter()` is tricky

Try not use anything special for the column names in `filter()`. This is why it is good to not use atypical column names. Then you can just use the column name!

So let's get rid of our unusual name in our data again.

```{r}
mtcars <- rename(mtcars, mpg = `mpg!`)
```

## Always good to check each step!

Did the filter work the way you expected? Did the dimensions change?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/5b5OU7aUekfdSAER5I/giphy.gif")
```
https://media.giphy.com/media/5b5OU7aUekfdSAER5I/giphy.gif

## `distinct()` function

To filter for distinct values from a variable, multiple variables, or an entire tibble you can use the `distinct()` function from the `dplyr` package.

```{r}
distinct(mtcars, cyl)

distinct(mtcars, cyl, gear)
```

## Summary

- `pull()` to get values out of a data frame/tibble
- `select()` is the `tidyverse` way to get a tibble with only certain columns
-  you can `select()` based on patterns in the column names
-  you can also `select()` based on column class with the `where()` function
-  you can combine multiple tidyselect functions together like `select(starts_with("C"), ends_with("state"))`
-  you can combine multiple patterns with the `c()` function like `select(starts_with(c("A", "C")))`
- `filter()` can be used to filter out rows based on logical conditions
-  avoid using quotes when referring to column names with `filter()`

## Summary Continued

- `==` is the same as equivalent to
- `&` means both conditions must be met to remain after `filter()`
- `|` means either conditions needs to be met to remain after `filter()`
- `distinct()` helps you filter for unique values

## Lab Part 2

🏠 [Class Website](https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/)    
💻 [Lab](https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/modules/Subsetting_Data_in_R/lab/Subsetting_Data_in_R_Lab.Rmd)


## Combining `filter` and `select`

You can combine `filter` and `select` to subset the rows and columns, respectively, of a data frame:

```{r}
select(filter(mtcars, mpg > 20), cyl)
```


## Nesting

In `R`, the common way to perform multiple operations is to wrap functions around each other in a "nested" form.

```{r}
head(select(mtcars, cyl), 2)
```

## Nesting can get confusing looking

```{r}
select(filter(mtcars, mpg > 20 & cyl == 4), cyl, hp)
```

## Assigning Temporary Objects

One can also create temporary objects and reassign them:

```{r}
mtcars2 <- filter(mtcars, mpg > 20 & cyl == 4)
mtcars2 <- select(mtcars2, cyl, hp)

head(mtcars2,4)
```

## Using the `pipe` (comes with `dplyr`):

The pipe `%>%` makes this much more readable.  It reads left side "pipes" into right side.  RStudio `CMD/Ctrl + Shift + M` shortcut. Pipe `mtcars` into `filter`, then pipe that into `select`:


```{r}
mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20 & cyl == 4) %>% select(cyl, hp)
```


# Adding/Removing Columns


## Adding columns to a data frame: dplyr (`tidyverse` way){.codesmall}

The `mutate` function in `dplyr` allows you to add or modify columns of a data frame.

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# General format - Not the code!
{data object to update} <- mutate({data to use}, 
                           {new variable name} = {new variable source}) 
```
</div>

```{r}
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars, newcol = wt / 2.2)
head(mtcars, 4)
```


## Use mutate to modify existing columns {.codesmall}

The `mutate` function in `dplyr` allows you to add or modify columns of a data frame.

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# General format - Not the code!
{data object to update} <- mutate({data to use}, 
                           {variable name to change} = {variable modification}) 
```
</div>

```{r}
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars, wt = wt * 2)
head(mtcars, 4)
```


## You can pipe data into mutate {.codesmall}


```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% mutate(wt = wt / 2)
head(mtcars,4)
```



## Removing columns of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

The `NULL` method is still very common.

The `select` function can remove a column with minus (`-`):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(mtcars, - newcol)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(select(mtcars, - newcol))
```

**Or, you can simply select the columns you want to keep, ignoring the ones you want to remove.**

## Removing columns in a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

You can use `c()` to list the columns to remove.

Remove `newcol` and `drat`:
```{r}
select(mtcars, -c("newcol", "drat"))
```


# Ordering columns

## Ordering the columns of a data frame: dplyr 

The `select` function can reorder columns.
```{r}
head(mtcars, 2)
select(mtcars, cyl, mpg, wt) %>%
head(2)
```

## Ordering the columns of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

The `select` function can reorder columns.  Put `newcol` first, then select the rest of columns:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(mtcars, newcol, everything())
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(select(mtcars, newcol, everything()), 3)
```

## Ordering the columns of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

Put `newcol` at the end ("remove, everything, then add back in"):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(mtcars, -newcol, everything(), newcol)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(select(mtcars, -newcol, everything(), newcol), 3)
```


## Ordering the column names of a data frame: alphabetically {.codesmall}

Using the base R `order()` function.

```{r}
order(colnames(mtcars))
mtcars %>% select(order(colnames(mtcars)))
```


## Ordering the columns of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

In addition to `select` we can also use the `relocate()` function of dplyr to rearrange the columns for more complicated moves.

For example, let say we just wanted `wt` to be before `cyl`.

```{r}

head(mtcars, 1)

mtcars_carb <- relocate(mtcars, wt, .before = cyl)

head(mtcars_carb, 1)
```



# Ordering rows

## Ordering the rows of a data frame: dplyr

The `arrange` function can reorder rows  By default, `arrange` orders in increasing order:
```{r}
arrange(mtcars, mpg)
```

## Ordering the rows of a data frame: dplyr

Use the `desc` to arrange the rows in descending order:
```{r}
arrange(mtcars, desc(mpg))
```

## Ordering the rows of a data frame: dplyr

You can combine increasing and decreasing orderings:
```{r}
arrange(mtcars, mpg, desc(hp))
```


## Summary

- `select()` and `filter()` can be combined together
- you can do sequential steps in a few ways:
    1. nesting them inside one another using parentheses `()`
    2. creating intermediate data objects in between
    3. using pipes `%>%` (like "then" statements)
- `select()` and `relocate()` can be used to reorder columns
- `arrange()` can be used to reorder rows
- can remove rows with `filter()`
- can remove a column in a few ways:  
    2. using `select()` with negative sign in front of column name(s)  
    3. not selecting it (without negative sign)  

## Summary cont...

- `mutate()` can be used to create new variables or modify them

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# General format - Not the code!
{data object to update} <- mutate({data to use}, 
                                {new variable name} = {new variable source}) 
```
</div>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars, newcol = wt/2.2)
```

## A note about base R: 

The `$` operator is similar to `pull()`. This is the base R way to do this:

```{r}
mtcars$carb
```

Although it is easier (for this one task), mixing and matching the `$` operator with tidyverse functions usually doesn't work. Therefore, we want to let you know about it in case you see it, but we suggest that you try working with the tidyverse way.

## Adding new columns to a data frame: base R

You can add a new column (or modify an existing one) using the `$` operator instead of `mutate`.

Just want you to be aware of this as it is very common.

```{r}
mtcars$newcol <- mtcars$wt/2.2
head(mtcars,3)
```

Even though `$` is easier for creating new columns, `mutate` is really powerful, so it's worth getting used to.
