## Recap
- R functions as a calculator
- Use `c()` to **combine** vectors
- Use `<-` to save (assign) values to objects
- if you don't use `<-` to reassign objects that you want to modify, they will stay the same
- `length()`, `class()`, and `str()` tell you information about an object
- `head()` and `tail()` can also help you inspect an object
- `readr`has helpful functions like `read_csv()` that can help you import data into R like so: 
`df_example_readr <- read_csv(file = "documents/data_analysis/data_file.csv")`
- Need to assign the output of the function to keep the result!

## Overview

In this module, we will show you how to:

1. Look at your data in different ways
4. Rename columns of a data frame
5. Subset rows of a data frame
6. Subset columns of a data frame
7. Add new columns to a data frame



## Setup

We will largely focus on the `dplyr` package which is part of the `tidyverse`.

```{r, fig.alt="dplyr", out.width = "25%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

Some resources on how to use `dplyr`: 

* https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html
* https://www.opencasestudies.org/




## Loading in dplyr and tidyverse

See this website for a list of the packages included in the `tidyverse`: https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr and other packages!
```

## Getting data to work with

We can take a look at the top of it by using the `head()` function.

```{r message=FALSE}
state_data <-read_csv("https://hutchdatascience.org/SeattleStatSummer_R/data/states.csv")
head(state_data)
```


## To see the bottom of the data use `tail()`
```{r}
tail(state_data) # looking at the bottom 6 rows of the mtcars data
```

## Checking the data: `glimpse()`

In addition to `head()` and `tail()`, the `glimpse()`function of the `dplyr` package  is another great function to look at your data. 

```{r}
glimpse(state_data)
```


## Renaming Columns of a data frame or tibble

To rename columns in `dplyr`, you can use the `rename` function.

 Notice the **new name** is listed **first**!

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# general format! not code!
{data you are creating or changing} <- {data you are using} %>% 
                            rename({New Name} = {Old name})
```
</div>

```{r}
state_data_rename <- state_data %>% rename(location = entity)
head(state_data_rename)
```
## Reassign the data!

If we don't reassign the data it will just print the change to the screen

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this does not change the data! Just prints the result
state_data %>% rename(location = entity)

# this makes a new data frame that is changed
state_data_rename <- state_data %>% rename(location = entity)

# this updates the existing data
state_data<- state_data %>% rename(location = entity)
```

## Unusual Column Names

It's best to avoid unusual column names where possible, as things get tricky later.

You can use  \` backticks\` to refer to them . You may see people use quotes in certain situations.

```{r, fig.alt="dplyr", out.width = "14%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/backtick_1.png")
```

Other atypical column names are those with:

- spaces
- number without characters
- number starting the name
- other punctuation marks (besides "_" or "." and not at the beginning)


## A solution!

Rename tricky column names so that you don't have to deal with them later!

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/6q29hxDKvJvPy/giphy.gif")
```



## Summary
- `head()`, `tail()`, and `glimpse()` help us look at the data
- the `rename()` function of `dplyr` can help you rename columns
- avoid using punctuation (except underscores), spaces, and numbers (to start or alone) in column names
- if you must do a nonstandard column name - typically use backticks around it. See https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/quotes_vs_backticks.html.
- avoid copy and pasting code from other sources - quotation marks will change!

# Subsetting Columns

## Subset columns of a data frame: dplyr

The `select` command from `dplyr` allows you to subset (still a data frame)
```{r}
state_data %>% select(cancer_mortality)
```

## Select multiple columns

We can use `select` to select for multiple columns.

```{r}

state_data %>% select(entity, cancer_mortality)
```


## See the Select "helpers"

Here are a few:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
last_col()
starts_with()
ends_with()
contains() # like searching
```

Type `tidyselect::` in the **console** and see what RStudio suggests:

```{r, fig.alt="dplyr", out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyselect.png")
```

## Select columns of a data frame: dplyr

The `select` command from `dplyr` allows you to subset columns matching patterns:

```{r}
state_data %>% select(starts_with("cancer"))
```


## Combining tidyselect helpers with regular selection

```{r}
state_data %>% select(entity, starts_with("cancer"))
```

## Sometimes we want to preview the values

We can use `pull()` for that to "pull out" the values.
This can give us a sense of the range, missing values, unusual values etc.

```{r}
state_data %>% pull(cancer_rate_per_100000)
```


# Subsetting Rows

## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr

The command in `dplyr` for subsetting rows is `filter`.

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# General format - Not the code!
{data object to update} <- {data to use} %>% 
                        filter({variable name} {some condition}) 
                          
```
</div>


```{r}
state_data %>% filter(cancer_rate_per_100000 < 130)
```


## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr

You can have multiple **conditions** using the following:

* `==` : equals to
* `!=`: not equal to (`!` : not/negation)
* `>` / `<`: greater than / less than
* `>=` or `<=`: greater than or equal to / less than or equal to
* `&` : AND
* `|` : OR

## Common error for filter

If you try to filter for a column that does not exist it will not work:
 
 - misspelled column name 
 - column that was already removed 



## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}

You can filter by two conditions using `&` (must meet both conditions):


```{r}
state_data %>% filter(cancer_rate_per_100000 < 130 & population > 4000000)
```

## Subset rows of a data frame: dplyr

If you want OR statements (meaning the data can meet either condition does not need to meet both), you need to use `|` between conditions:

```{r}
state_data %>% filter(cancer_rate_per_100000 < 130 | population > 20000000)


```


## Be careful with column names and `filter`

This will not work the way you might expect! Best to stick with nothing but the column name if it is a typical name. Use backticks if it isn't typical.

```{r}
state_data %>% filter("cancer_rate_per_100000"< 130)
```

## Always good to check each step!

Did the filter work the way you expected? Did the dimensions change?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/5b5OU7aUekfdSAER5I/giphy.gif")
```

## Summary

- `pull()` to get values out of a data frame/tibble
- `select()` is the `tidyverse` way to get a tibble with only certain columns
-  you can `select()` based on patterns in the column names
-  you can also `select()` based on column class with the `where()` function
-  you can combine multiple tidyselect functions together like `select(starts_with("C"), ends_with("state"))`
- `filter()` can be used to filter out rows based on logical conditions
-  avoid using quotes when referring to column names with `filter()`

## Summary Continued

- `==` is the same as equivalent to
- `&` means both conditions must be met to remain after `filter()`
- `|` means either conditions needs to be met to remain after `filter()`

# Adding/Removing Columns


## Adding columns to a data frame: dplyr (`tidyverse` way){.codesmall}

The `mutate` function in `dplyr` allows you to add or modify columns of a data frame.

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# General format - Not the code!
{data object to update} <- {data to use} %>% 
                      mutate({new variable name} = {new variable source}) 
```
</div>

```{r}
state_updated <- state_data %>% 
                mutate(newcol = cancer_mortality / population)
```


## Let's take a look

```{r}
glimpse(state_updated)
```
## Use mutate to modify existing columns {.codesmall}

The `mutate` function in `dplyr` allows you to add or modify columns of a data frame.

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# General format - Not the code!
{data object to update} <- {data to use} %>%
                mutate({variable name to change} = {variable modification}) 
```
</div>

```{r}
state_updated<- state_updated %>%
              mutate(newcol = newcol *1000000)
```

## Let's take a look

```{r}
glimpse(state_updated)
```

## Let's rename the new column

```{r}

state_updated<- state_updated %>%
              rename(cancer_mortality_rate_per_1000000 = newcol)
```


## Let's take a look with summarize & filter

```{r}
state_updated %>% summarise(
  range = range(cancer_mortality_rate_per_1000000, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
state_updated %>% filter(cancer_mortality_rate_per_1000000 < 1100)

```

## How does this compare with overall mortality
```{r}
state_updated %>% summarise(
  range = range(cancer_mortality, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
state_data %>% filter(cancer_mortality < 1100)
```

## Removing columns of a data frame: dplyr {.codesmall}


The `select` function can remove a column with minus (`-`):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
state_updated %>% select(-cancer_mortality_rate_per_100000)
```


**Or, you can simply select the columns you want to keep, ignoring the ones you want to remove.**

## Let's make a smaller data frame {.codesmall}


```{r}
smaller <- state_updated %>% select(entity, starts_with("cancer"))
head(smaller)
```


## Reordering rows

The `arrange()` function can be a big help! It automatically does it in smallest to largest order.
```{r}
smaller %>% arrange(cancer_mortality_rate_per_1000000)
```

## A note about base R: 

The `$` operator is similar to `pull()`. This is the base R way to do this:

```{r}
mtcars$carb
```

Although it is easier (for this one task), mixing and matching the `$` operator with tidyverse functions usually doesn't work. Therefore, we want to let you know about it in case you see it, but we suggest that you try working with the tidyverse way.



## Summary

- can subset or remove rows with `filter()`
- can subset or remove (select what we want to keep) columns with `select()`
- `mutate()` can be used to create new variables or modify them

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# General format - Not the code!
{data object to update} <- {data to use} %>% 
                        mutate({new variable name} = {new variable source}) 
```
</div>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars, newcol = wt/2.2)
```
