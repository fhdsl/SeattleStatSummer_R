## Common new users frustrations

1.  **Different versions of software**
1.  **Data type problems (is that a character or a number?)**
2.  Working directory problems: trying to read files that R "can't find"
    - RStudio can help, and so do RStudio Projects
    - discuss in Data Input/Output lecture
3.  Typos (R is **case sensitive**, `x` and `X` are different)
    - RStudio helps with "tab completion"
    - discussed throughout

## Explaining output on slides

In slides, a command (we'll also call them code or a code chunk) will look like this

```{r code}
print("I'm code")
```

And then directly after it, will be the output of the code.  
So `print("I'm code")` is the code chunk and [1] "I'm code" is the output.

## R as a calculator

```{r calcDemo}
2 + 2
2 * 4
2^3
```

Note: when you type your command, R inherently thinks you want to print the result. 

## R as a calculator

- The R console is a full calculator
- Try to play around with it:
    - +, -, /, * are add, subtract, divide and multiply
    - ^ or ** is power
    - parentheses -- ( and ) -- work with order of operations 
    - %% finds the remainder

## R as a calculator

```{r calcDemo2}
2 + (2 * 3)^2
(1 + 3) / 2 + 45
6 / 2 * (1 + 2)
```

```{r, fig.alt="Problem gives answer of 1 or 9 depending on calculator.", out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE, out.extra='style="float:left"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Basic_R_calculator.jpg")
```

```{r, fig.alt="Problem gives answer of 1 or 9 depending on calculator.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, out.extra='style="float:left"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Basic_R_viral_math_problem.png")
```

## R as a calculator

Try evaluating the following:

- `2 + 2 * 3 / 4 -3`
- `2 * 3 / 4 * 2`
- `2^4 - 1`

## Commenting in Scripts

`#` creates a comment in R code

```{r}
# this is a comment

# nothing to its right is evaluated

# this # is still a comment
### you can use many #'s as you want

1 + 2 # Can be the right of code
```

In an `.Rmd` file, you can write notes outside the R chunks.

## Assigning values to objects

- You can create objects from within the R environment and from files on your computer
- R uses `<-` to assign values to an object name (you might also see `=` used, but this is not best practice)
- Object names are case-sensitive, i.e. X and x are different

```{r assign}
x <- 2
x
x * 4
x + 2
```

## Assigning values to objects

- The most comfortable and familiar class/data type for many of you will be `data.frame`
- You can think of these as essentially spreadsheets with rows (usually subjects or observations) and columns (usually variables)
- `data.frame`s are somewhat advanced objects in R; we will start with simpler objects

## Assigning values to objects

- Here we introduce "1 dimensional" classes; often referred to as 'vectors'
- Vectors can have multiple sets of observations, but each observation has to be the same class.

```{r assignClass}
class(x)
y <- "hello world!"
print(y)
class(y)
```

## Simple object practice

Try assigning your full name to an R object called `name`

## Simple object practice

Try assigning your full name to an R object called `name`

```{r myName}
name <- "Ava Hoffman"
name
```

## The 'combine' function

The function `c()` collects/combines/joins single R objects into a vector of R objects. It is mostly used for creating vectors of numbers, character strings, and other data types. 

```{r assign3a}
x <- c(1, 4, 6, 8)
x
class(x)
```

## The 'combine' function

Try assigning your first and last name as 2 separate character strings into a single vector called `name2`

## The 'combine' function

Try assigning your first and last name as 2 separate character strings into a length-2 vector called `name2`

```{r myName2}
name2 <- c("Ava", "Hoffman")
name2
```

## Arguments inside R functions

- The contents you give to an R function are called "arguments"
- Here, R assumes all arguments should be objects contained in the vector
- We will talk more about arguments as we use more complicated functions!

```{r eval = FALSE}
name2 <- c("Ava", "Hoffman")
# Arg 1    ^^^^^
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
name2 <- c("Ava", "Hoffman")
# Arg 2           ^^^^^^^^^
```

## `length` of R objects

`length()`: Get or set the length of vectors (including lists) and factors, and of any other R object for which a method has been defined.

```{r assign3b}
length(x)
y
length(y)
```

## `length` of R objects

What do you expect for the length of the `name` variable? What about the `name2` variable?

What are the lengths of each?

##  `length` of R objects

What do you expect for the length of the `name` variable? What about the `name2` variable?

What are the lengths of each?

```{r myName3}
length(name)
length(name2)
```

## Math + vector objects

You can perform functions to entire vectors of numbers very easily.

```{r assign4}
x + 2
x * 3
x + c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## Math + vector objects

But things like algebra can only be performed on numbers.

```{r, error=TRUE}
name2 + 4
```

## Reassigning to a new object

Save these modified vectors as a new vector called `y`.

```{r assign5}
y <- x + c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y
```

Note that the R object `y` is no longer "hello  world!" - It has been overwritten by assigning new data to the same name.

## Reassigning to a new object

Reassigning allows you to make changes "in place"

```{r eval = FALSE}
# results not stored:
x + c(1, 2, 3, 4)

# x remains unchanged, results stored in `y`:
y <- x + c(1, 2, 3, 4)

# replace `x` in place
x <- x + c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

## R variables

You can get more attributes than just class. The function `str()` gives you the structure of the object.

```{r assign2}
str(x)
str(y)
```

This tells you that `x` is a numeric vector and tells you the length.

## R variables

This is handy when we start dealing with bigger / more complex objects.

```{r include=FALSE}
z <- sample(y, size = 100, replace = T)
```

```{r}
str(z)
```

## Summary

- R functions as a calculator
- Use `<-` to save (assign) values to objects
- Use `c()` to **combine** vectors
- `length()`, `class()`, and `str()` tell you information about an object
