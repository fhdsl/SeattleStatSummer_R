## Outline 

* Part 0: A little bit of set up!
* Part 1: reading in manually (point and click)
* Part 2: reading in directly, reading XLSX file (Excel file), other data inputs
* Part 3: working directories, relative vs. absolute paths

We will cover Output a bit later!


# Part 0: Setup - R Project


## New R Project

Let's make an R Project so we can stay organized in the next steps.

Click the new R Project button at the top left of RStudio:

```{r, fig.alt="The New R Project button is highlighted.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_Rproject.png")
```


## New R Project

In the New Project Wizard, click "New Directory":

```{r, fig.alt="In the New Project Wizard, the 'New Directory' option is highlighted.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_new_directory.png")
```


## New R Project

Click "New Project":

```{r, fig.alt="In the New Project Wizard, the 'New Project' option is highlighted.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_new_project.png")
```


## New R Project

Type in a name for your new folder.

Store it somewhere easy to find, such as your Desktop:

```{r, fig.alt="In the New Project Wizard, the new project has been given a name and is going to be stored in the Desktop directory. The 'Create Project' button is highlighted.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_new_project_details.png")
```


## New R Project

You now have a new R Project folder on your Desktop! 

Make sure you add any scripts or data files to this folder as we go through today's lesson. This will make sure R is able to "find" your files.

```{r, fig.alt="The image shows an image of an arrow pointing to the newly created R project repository.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_new_desktop.png")
```


# Part 1: Getting data into R (manual/point and click)


## Data Input

* 'Reading in' data is the first step of any real project/analysis
* R can read almost any file format, especially via add-on packages
* We are going to focus on simple delimited files first
    * comma separated (e.g. '.csv')
    * tab delimited (e.g. '.txt')
    * Microsoft Excel (e.g. '.xlsx')


## Note: data for demonstration

* We have added functionality to load some datasets directly in the `jhur` package


## Data Input

Youth Tobacco Survey (YTS) dataset:

"The YTS was developed to provide states with comprehensive data on both middle school and high school students regarding tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, smoking cessation, school curriculum, minors' ability to purchase or otherwise obtain tobacco products, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco, and familiarity with pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco media messages."

* Check out the data at: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/youth-tobacco-survey-yts-data


## Data Input: Dataset Location

Dataset is located at http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv

* Download data by clicking the above link
    
    * Safari - if a file loads in your browser, choose File --> Save As, select, Format "Page Source" and save


## Import Dataset

> File
> Import Dataset
> From Text (`readr`)
> paste the url (http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv)
> click "Update" and "Import"


## Import Dataset

```{r, fig.alt="Gif showing the process of importing a dataset via readr.", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_import_dataset.gif")
```

## What Just Happened?

You see a preview of the data on the top left pane.

```{r, fig.alt="The image shows an image of an arrow pointing to the newly created R project repository.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_data_imported.png")
```


## What Just Happened?

You see a new object called `Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data` in your environment pane (top right). The table button opens the data for you to view.

```{r, fig.alt="The image shows an image of an arrow pointing to the newly created R project repository.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_data_imported.png")
```


## What Just Happened?

R ran some code in the console (bottom left).

```{r, fig.alt="The image shows an image of an arrow pointing to the newly created R project repository.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_code_ran.png")
```


## Browsing for Data on Your Machine

```{r, fig.alt="The image shows an image of an arrow pointing to the newly created R project repository.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_browse.png")
```


## Manual Import: Pros and Cons

Pros: easy!!

Cons: obscures some of what's happening, others will have difficulty running your code

# Part 2: Getting data into R (directly)


## Data Input: Read in Directly 

```{r message = FALSE}
# load library `readr` that contains function `read_csv`
library(readr)
dat <- read_csv(
  file = "http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv"
  )

# `head` displays first few rows of a data frame. `tail()` works the same way.
head(dat, n = 5)
```

## Data Input: Declaring Arguments

```{r message = FALSE}
dat <- read_csv(
  file = "http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv"
  )
# EQUIVALENT TO
dat <- read_csv(
  "http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv"
  )
```

## Data Input: Read in Directly 

So what is going on "behind the scenes"? 

`read_csv()` parses a "flat" text file (.csv) and turns it into a **tibble** -- a rectangular data frame, where data are split into rows and columns 

- First, a flat  file is parsed into a rectangular matrix of strings

- Second, the type of each column is determined (heuristic-based guess)


## Data Input: Read in Directly 

`read_csv()` needs the path to your file. It will return a tibble

```
read_csv(file, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL,
  locale = default_locale(), na = c("", "NA"),
  quoted_na = TRUE, quote = "\"", comment = "", trim_ws = TRUE,
  skip = 0, n_max = Inf, guess_max = min(1000, n_max),
  progress = show_progress(), skip_empty_rows = TRUE
)
```

- `file` is the path to your file, in quotes 
- can be path in your local computer -- absolute file path or relative file path 
- can be path to a file on a website

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Examples

dat <- read_csv(file = "/Users/avahoffman/Downloads/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv")

dat <- read_csv(file = "Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv")

dat <- read_csv(file = "www.someurl.com/table1.csv")
```


## Data Input: Read in Directly 

Great, but what is my "path"?

```{r, fig.alt="GIF with text. PC: *autosaves file* Me: Cool, so where did the file save? PC: shows image of Power Rangers shrugging.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_where_are_the_files.gif")
```


## Data Input: Read in Directly 

Luckily, we already set up an R Project! 

```{r, fig.alt="Image showing the csv dataset being moved to the R Project directory created earlier.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_file_move.png")
```

If we add the Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv file to the intro_to_r folder, we can use the relative path:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- read_csv(file = "Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv")
```


## Data Input: Read in Directly 

`read_csv()` is a special case of `read_delim()` -- a general function to read a delimited file into a data frame  

`read_delim()` needs path to your file and file's delimiter, will return a tibble

```
read_delim(file, delim, quote = "\"", escape_backslash = FALSE, 
  escape_double = TRUE, col_names = TRUE,  col_types = NULL, 
  locale = default_locale(),na = c("", "NA"),  quoted_na = TRUE, 
  comment = "", trim_ws = FALSE, skip = 0, 
  n_max = Inf,  guess_max = min(1000, n_max), 
  progress = show_progress(), skip_empty_rows = TRUE
)
```

- `file` is the path to your file, in quotes 
- `delim` is what separates the fields within a record 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Examples
dat <- read_delim(file = "Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv", delim = ",")

dat <- read_delim(file = "www.someurl.com/table1.txt", delim = "\t")
```


## Data Input: Read in Directly From File Path

Move the data to the data folder and change the relative path:

```{r eval = FALSE}
dat <- read_csv(file = "data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv")
```

The data is now successfully read into your R environment. You can confirm this by checking the "Environment" pane (top right). Column specification of first few columns is printed to the console. 


## Common new user mistakes we have seen

1.  **Working directory problems: trying to read files that R "can't find"**
    - Path misspecification 
    - more on this shortly!
2.  Typos (R is **case sensitive**, `x` and `X` are different)
    - RStudio helps with "tab completion"
3.  Open ended quotes, parentheses, and brackets     
4.  Different versions of software
5.  Deleting part of the code chunk


## Data Input: Checking the data

- the `View()` function shows your data in a new tab, in spreadsheet format
- be careful if your data is big!

```{r eval = FALSE}
View(dat)
```

```{r, fig.alt="Screenshot of the RStudio console. 'View(dat)' has been typed and the data appears in table format.", out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_View_data.png")
```


## Data Input: Checking the data

The `str()` function shows you the structure of the data (different variables and their classes - more on this later).

```{r}
str(dat)
```


## Help

For any function, you can write `?FUNCTION_NAME`, or `help("FUNCTION_NAME")` to look at the help file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?read_delim
help("read_delim")
```

```{r, fig.alt="Screenshot of the RStudio console. '?read_delim' has been typed and the help page has appeared in the help pane on the right.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_read_delim.png")
```


## Data Input: base R 

There are also data importing functions provided in base R (rather than the `readr` package), like `read.delim()` and `read.csv()`. 

These functions have slightly different syntax for reading in data (e.g. `header` argument). 

However, while many online resources use the base R tools, the latest version of RStudio switched to use these new `readr` data import tools, so we will use them in the class for slides. They are also up to two times faster for reading in large datasets, and have a progress bar which is nice. 


## Data Input: Excel files

- You **cannot** read in an excel file from a URL.
- Need to load the `readxl` package with `library()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)

read_excel("mtcars.xlsx")
```


## Data input: other file types

* `haven` package has functions to read SAS, SPSS, Stata formats

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(haven)

# SAS
read_sas(file = "mtcars.sas7bdat")

# SPSS
read_sav(file = "mtcars.sav")

# Stata
read_dta(file = "mtcars.dta")
```


## Summary: `readr` highlights - Part 2

- Modern, improved tools from `readr` R package: `read_delim()`, `read_csv()`
  - needs a file path to be provided 
  - parses the file into rows/columns, determines column type 
  - returns a tibble (data frame)

- Some functions to look at a data frame: 
  - `head()` shows first few rows
  - `tail()` shows the last few rows
  - `View()` shows the data as a spreadsheet
  - `str()` tells you about column types


## Summary: other file types

* From `readr` package: 
  - `read_delim()`: general delimited files 
  - `read_csv()`: comma separated (CSV) files
  - `read_tsv()`: tab separated files
  - others 
  
* For reading Excel files, you can do one of: 
  - use `read_excel()` function from `readxl` package
  - use other packages: `xlsx`, `openxlsx`

## Working Directories

Working directory is a directory that R assumes "you are working in". It's where R looks for files.

"Setting working directory" means specifying the path to the directory.

```{r workingDirectory,eval=FALSE}
# get the working directory
getwd()

# set the working directory
setwd("/Users/avahoffman/Desktop")
```

R uses working directory as a starting place when searching for files.

```{r, fig.alt="The files are in the computer text overlaid on still shot of the movie Zoolander.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/files.jpg")
```

## Working Directories

R uses working directory as a starting place when searching for files:

* if you use `read_csv("Bike_Lanes_Long.csv")`, R assumes that the file is **in** the working directory

* if you use `read_csv("data/Bike_Lanes_Long.csv")`, R assumes that `data` directory is **in** the working directory

* if you use an absolute path, e.g. `read_csv("/Users/avahoffman/data/Bike_Lanes_Long.csv")`, the working directory information is not used


## Working Directories

Setting up an R Project can avoid headaches by telling R that the working directory is wherever the `.Rproj` file is.

```{r, fig.alt="Image showing the RStudio console. There is an arrow pointing to the .Rproj file. The top right corner shows that the 'Intro_to_r' project has been selected.", out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Data_Input_Rproj_file.png")
```


## Summary

- R Projects are a good way to keep your files organized and reduce headaches
- Use `read_csv()` and `read_delim()` from the `readr` package to read in your data
- Don't forget to use `<-` to assign your data to an object!
- Use `str()` to understand objects
- Use `head()` and `tail()` to preview the first and last lines of the data
