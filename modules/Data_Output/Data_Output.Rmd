## Data Output

While its nice to be able to read in a variety of data formats, it's equally important to be able to output data somewhere.

The `readr` package provides data exporting functions which have the pattern `write_*`: 

- `write_csv()`, 
- `write_delim()`, others. 

From `write_csv()` documentation:  

```
write_csv(x, file, 
  na = "NA", append = FALSE, 
  col_names = !append, quote_escape = "double",
  eol = "\n", path = deprecated()
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv")
```

## Data Output

`x`: data frame you want to write

`file`:  file path where you want to R object written; it can be: 

* an absolute path, 
* a relative path (relative to your working directory), 
* a file name only (which writes the file to your working directory)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Examples

write_csv(dat, file = "YouthTobacco_newNames.csv")

write_delim(dat, file = "YouthTobacco_newNames.csv", delim = ",")
```


## R binary file

`.rds` is an extension for R native file format.

`write_rds()` and `read_rds()` from `readr` package can be used to write/read a single R object to/from file.

Saving datasets in `.rds` format can save time if you have to read it back in later.

```{r}
# write an object: a data frame "dat"
write_rds(dat, file = "yts_dataset.rds")

# write an object: vector "x"
x <- c(1, 3, 3)
write_rds(x, file = "my_vector.rds")

# read an object from file and assign to a new object named "y"
x2 <- read_rds(file = "my_vector.rds")
x2
```


## Summary

- Use `write_csv()` and `write_delim()` from the `readr` package to write your (modified) data
- `.rds` files can be handy for saving intermediate work
