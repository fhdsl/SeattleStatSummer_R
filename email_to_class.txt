You can find detailed instructions on how to do this on the CoursePlus Content page for Session 0.

Pre-class homework:

Signing up for the class Slack channel:

We have launched a Slack workspace for the 140.640 - Introduction to R [SI 2021-22] class. For those of you who are using Slack for the first time: Slack is a collaboration platform that allows connecting people within a group or organization. Here, we have created a Slack workspace to facilitate discussion within students themselves, as well as with TAs and instructors. We hope this chat platform will allow you to discuss and clarify lecture content and homework. Slack has worked well for that purpose in other classes' offerings, and we hope it will continue to be a useful tool for you. 

To join the Slack workspace for 140.640 - Introduction to R [SI 2021-22], use the following invitation link and follow the instructions:
https://join.slack.com/t/140640introdu-wnv5964/shared_invite/zt-rd7hbusy-Jr5Vid8n3~GU7ITANGYY9w
Once joined, to access the Slack workspace, use the link: 
https://app.slack.com/client/T023TPZA8LF/C024YBC75NU
Once you log in to the Slack workspace, you should be able to see a welcome message displayed in the "general" channel which includes a short Slack tutorial too.


See everyone on Monday!

Thanks,
Ava, Carrie, and Marta
