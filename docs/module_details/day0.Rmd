# Day 0

## Objectives

Upon completion of this session, you will be able to do the following:

1. Successfully install R and RStudio.
2. Install your first R packages.

## Material

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# The str_replace_all creates an absolute url to linked documents. Important because there are word and pdf rendered versions of the syllabus.
# The filter() step removes all dates but this date to make a smaller table.
pander::pandoc.table(
  schedule %>%
    urls_for_module_details() %>%
    filter(
      row_number() >= which(str_detect(schedule$`**Day**`, "\\[Day 0\\]")) &
        row_number() < which(str_detect(schedule$`**Day**`, "\\[Day 1\\]"))
    ),
  missing = "",
  split.tables = Inf,
  style = "rmarkdown"
)
``` 


## Instructions

- Install the latest version of R `r config::get("r_version")`
  - For Mac users: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/base/R-4.2.2.pkg (may need to copy-paste the link to the browser)
  - For Windows users: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.2.2-win.exe (may need to copy-paste the link to the browser)
  - For other operating systems, or if you prefer to access the download link from the official website, visit: http://cran.us.r-project.org

  - For Windows users: https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2022.12.0-353.exe (may need to copy-paste the link to the browser and you will need Windows 10 or 11)
  - A more detailed walk-through of the steps above is provided in [R_and_RStudio_installation](../../modules/Setup/R_and_RStudio_installation.html)    .

If you are using a computer issued from Hopkins, you may need to work with the IT department in advance to do these installations.
