140.604.73**

**Class Website:** http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/   
**CoursePlus:** https://courseplus.jhu.edu/core/index.cfm/go/syl:syl.public.view/coid/16733/

**Zoom link will be emailed to students.**

**Day/Time:** Jan 10 - 21: 8:30AM-11:50AM on Zoom

**Instructors:** Carrie Wright (cwrigh60@jhu.edu), Ava Hoffman (ava.hoffman@jhu.edu), and Candace Savonen (csavone1@jhu.edu)

**Communication will mainly occur through Slack and we will email you about how to connect to slack.**

**Overview:** This course will provide **"hands-on" training** for learning how to analyze data in the R statistical software package. We will cover data input/output, data management and manipulation, and how to make useful and informative graphics

**Course Format:** Each class will consist of 2 or 3 hour-long modules: each module features a lecture and an R programming lab, where students apply the skills taught in the modules to real data.

By the end of the course, students should be comfortable:

- Reading data into R
- Recoding and manipulating data
- Using R add-on packages
- Making exploratory plots
- Performing basic statistical tests
- Understanding basic programming syntax
- Creating reproducible R documents

## Zoom:

* Zoom link will be emailed to students
* Class sessions will be recorded and later posted
* We will have lectures as well as breakout room sessions to work on labs
* Please be aware that there is the option to use closed captioning:

* During lectures you can indicate how you feel about the pace of the course like so:

* In breakout room sessions you can ask for help like so:

* If you have a question based on our labs or homework (or not covered during lecture time), we ask that you post it on slack (which will be our main communication method - the link will be emailed). This allows for questions to be seen by everyone, not just the students in your breakout room. If another student does not answer your question (which we encourage!), we will try to answer it within 24 hours. If you feel uncomfortable posting a question publicly, let a TA or instructor know your question and we will post it for you anonymously.
