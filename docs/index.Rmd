## Overview
***

**Welcome to Introduction to R for Public Health Researchers!**  

This course is for students who have little to no familiarity with the R programming language and want to learn more about how to use R to import, wrangle, visualize, and analyze data.

The course will provide students with **“hands-on” training** for analyzing data with the R programming language for statistical computing, a popular open-source solution for data analysis and visualization.
