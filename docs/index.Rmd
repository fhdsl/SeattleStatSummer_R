## Overview: 
***

**Welcome to Introduction to R for Public Health Researchers!**  

This course is for students who have little to no familiarity with the R programming language and want to learn more about how to use R to import, wrangle, visualize, and analyze data.

The course will provide students with **“hands-on” training** for analyzing data with the R programming language for statistical computing, a popular open-source solution for data analysis and visualization.

## Zoom:
***

* Zoom link will be emailed to students
* Class sessions will be recorded and later posted
* We will have lectures as well as breakout room sessions to work on labs
* Please be aware that there is the option to use closed captioning:

* During lectures you can indicate how you feel about the pace of the course like so:

* In breakout room sessions you can ask for help like so:

* If you have a question based on our labs or homework (or not covered during lecture time), we ask that you post it on slack (which will be our main communication method - the link will be emailed). This allows for questions to be seen by everyone, not just the students in your breakout room. If another student does not answer your question (which we encourage!), we will try to answer it within 24 hours. If you feel uncomfortable posting a question publicly, let a TA or instructor know your question and we will post it for you anonymously.
