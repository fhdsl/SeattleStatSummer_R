## What is R?

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics

- R is the open source implementation of the [S language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)), which was developed by [Bell laboratories](https://ca.slack-edge.com/T023TPZA8LF-U024EN26Q0L-113294823b2c-512) in the 70s.

- The aim of the S language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"

```{r, fig.alt="Bell Labs old logo", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Bell_Laboratories_logo.svg/2880px-Bell_Laboratories_logo.svg.png")
```

## What is R?

- In 1991 **R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand began developing R

- R is named partly after the first names of the first two authors and  a play on the name of S.

- R is both [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development)

```

## Why R?

* High level language designed for statistical computing

* Powerful and flexible - especially for data wrangling and visualization

* Free (open source)

* Extensive add-on software (packages)

* Strong community 

```{r, fig.alt="R-Ladies - a non-profit civil society community", out.width = "25%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/img/R-LadiesGlobal_RBG_online_LogoOnly.png")
```
(source: https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/)

## Why not R?

* Fairly steep learning curve

    * "Programming" oriented
    
    * Minimal interface
    
* Little centralized support, relies on online community and package developers

* Annoying to update

* Slower, and more memory intensive, than the more traditional programming languages (C, Java, Perl, Python)

## Introductions

What do you hope to get out of the class?

Why do you want to use R?

```{r, fig.alt="image of rocks with word hope painted on", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}

<!-- 3. Final "Project": 35%  -->

<!-- ## Grading -->

<!-- * **Homework 1**: Due Tuesday by class -->

<!-- * **Homework 2**: Due Thursday by class -->

<!-- * **Homework 3**: Due Friday by class -->

## Installing R

* Install the latest version from: [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/ )

* [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Collection of R packages

We have an R package called jhur that will make sure all the packages are installed.

You can just copy and paste the below code into your console - we'll explain what it all means in the next day or two

```{r, packageInstall, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("muschellij2/jhur")
```

Note it may take ~5-10 minutes to run.
