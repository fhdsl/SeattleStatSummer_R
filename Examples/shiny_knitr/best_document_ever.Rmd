I think the $\alpha$ parameter needs to be set better in the model:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("RStudio/r-rstudio-1-3-console.png")
```


$$
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_{i} &=& \alpha + \beta x_{i} + \varepsilon_{i} \\
Z_{i} &=& \gamma + \beta x_{i} + \varepsilon_{i} 
\end{eqnarray}
$$

I think the paper by @eloyan2013semiparametric is awesome!
I like to cite it by [@eloyan2013semiparametric].

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
The mean distance of each car is `r mean(cars$dist)` miles.

The equation was


```{r}
model = lm( mpg ~ cyl + carb, data = mtcars)
tab = broom::tidy(model, conf_int = TRUE)
knitr::kable(tab)
# DT::datatable(tab)
pander::pander(tab)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
